# O.O.P Final Project - BlackJack
## A simple game of BlackJack for up to four friends to play against the house/Dealer
## I have chosen this project because it is something I am familier with and have enjoyed with friends in the past
## How to run
To use this code, you will need the java and class files for Final_Project and Dealer together to play
(Taken using Eclipse)

##Code Example
This portion I'm especially happy with how well it diplays and collects the value for a player's hand
