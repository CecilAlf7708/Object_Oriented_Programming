This repository is for my use during this course of learnung how to write, use, and share code as a programmer, using files required for assignments, and big final projects.

I am someone who aspires to be a game developer and create my own games that the public will be able to enjoy and remind them for the good years of gaming,
hence why I am taking this Software class so that I may learn to do so.
